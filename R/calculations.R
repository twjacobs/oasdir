#' Indexed earnings are FICA earnings that have been adjusted using

#' indexing year over the Average Wage Index for the year the earnings

#' the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) year (i.e., the

# early retirement -
  # the PIA benefit is reduced 5/9 of one percent for each month
  # before normal retirement age, up to 36 months.
  # If the number of months exceeds 36, then the benefit is
  # further reduced 5/12 of one percent per month.
  # For example, if the number of reduction months is 60
  # then the benefit is reduced by 30 percent.
  # This maximum reduction is calculated as 36 months times 5/9 of 1 percent
  # plus 24 months times 5/12 of 1 percent.



# delayed retirement
  # credit is given according to a table of adjustments
  # (piaAdjustments$`Percent Yearly Credit`). These adjustment
  # values are given as yearly adjustments but applied by the
  # number of months delayed.
