\title{Indexed earnings are FICA earnings that have been adjusted using
a ratio of the National Averge Wage Index (AWI) for an individuals
indexing year over the Average Wage Index for the year the earnings
were realized. The indexing year is the year two years prior to
the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) year. In other words, it is the
year a person turns 60. This function returns the Average Indexed
Monthly Earnings (AIME) for the highest 35 years of indexed
earnings. Note the AIME calculation always uses 35 years of earnings
even if it means some years of $0 earnings must be included. If the
endYear is in the future, estimates of FICA earnings and AWI are used
and appropriate warnings are issued.}

\arguments{
\item{ssStmt}{the Social Security Statement as retrieved through read_xml_ssStatement()}

\item{predict}{if TRUE, use a MARS model to predict future FICA earnings in the AIME calculation}
